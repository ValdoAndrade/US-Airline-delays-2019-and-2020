## U.S. Ailine Delays Analysis ( December 2019 and December 2020)

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This data project aims to provide insights into airline delays in the United States for December 2019 and December  2020. 
Microsoft Excel was used to explore trends in delays, identify contributing factors and to perform a visual analysis in order to develop data-driven recommendations and gain a deep understanding of the flight delays.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle 
Airline Delays 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eugeniyosetrov/airline-delays

### Key insights 
Which airlines experienced the most delays and cancellations in December 2019 and 2020 ?
What is the average number of minutes delayed among different airlines? Which had the most average minute delay?
Which airline demonstrated superior performance , as measured by the lowest average delay time and number of cancellations  during that period time ?
What were the primary causes of the delays across different airlines and airports ? 
How did the average number of minutes of flight delays vary between airlines from December 2019 to December 2020?
### Tools 
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, Pivot tables, Visualisation and calculations.

### Data cleaning /preparation
